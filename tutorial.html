				<p>Having a population of workers that live and work in the same community is the cornerstone of building a sustainable place. The impact of a closer commmute can affect your environment, personal well-being, and bank account.</p>
				<p>Workers who live closer to their job save time and gas money. Less hours in traffic mean more hours resting or enjoying time with your family. It also means you are spending less money on your vehicle and more on the things you would prefer to spend money on. Furthermore, staying closer to home means you are more likely to buy lunch or go shop nearby and support local businesses and the local tax base. Other benefits of closer commutes include improved air quality, lowered stress levels from less time in traffic, and having the option to walk or bike to work.</p>
				<p>So, we know the benefits of a local or homegrown workforce, but how can we build, leverage, or support one?</p>
				<p>The Department of Labor and The Employment and Training Administration offer a number of grants to help support initiatives designed to create more sustainable communities through increased options for commuters to work close to home. These grants are available to those communities that can show a viable need and opportunity for supporting a local workforce through industry and educational partners.</p>
				<p>This tutorial will walk you through a three step process of how to do just that! First, we will demonstrate the local manufacturing capacity of a site. Then, identify local industry and educational partners. Last, we will view all of these layers in an interactive environment to understand more about our homegrown workforce. All you will need is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/earth/download/ge/agree.html">Google Earth</a> and the links on this webpage.</p>
				<p>When you are ready to learn how to identify your homegrown workforce, click STEP ONE below.</p>

					<h4 class="subheader">Demonstrate Local Manufacturing Capacity</h4>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_Final.png" width="570" height="380"/>
						<p class="caption">KML Showing Local Manufacturing Capacity in Forrest City, AR</p>
						
					<p>By the end of this first step, you will be able to view the above image in Google Earth. To start, we are going to use OnTheMap from the US Census to collect our data. Click <a target="_blank" href="http://onthemap.ces.census.gov/">here</a> to open OnTheMap in a new tab.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_1.png" width="609" height="340"/>
						<p class="caption">Start View of OnTheMap from the US Census</p>
					
					<p>On the left side of the page, you will see various menus. In the menu box for "Search", enter the place of &#8220;Forrest City, AR&#8221;.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_2.png" />
						<p class="caption">Text to Search</p>
					<p>Now click the dropdown menu and change the search parameters to include only &#8220;Places (Cities, CDPs, etc.)&#8221;.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_3.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Category for Search</p>
					<p>Now click the "Search" and you should see the results of your search. In this case we see &#8220;<b>Forrest City city, AR</b>&#8221;.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_4.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Search Results</p>
					<p>Click &#8220;<b>Forrest City city, AR</b>&#8221; and the map will reflect our new selection.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_5.png" width="609" height="340"/>
						<p class="caption">Map Results</p>
					<p>At the center of our selection area, is a pop-up box that gives up some options. Click the option to <font style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline"><b>Perform Analysis on Selection Area</b></font> to bring up settings for analyzing the area. </p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_6.png" width="618" height="355"/>
						<p class="caption">Analysis Settings</p>
					<p>This menu has four columns: <b>Home/Work Area</b>, <b>Analysis Type</b>, <b>Year</b>, and <b>Job Type</b>. Make the following adjustments to the settings menu:
					<ul>
						<li>Set the <b>Home/Work Area</b> to Home, because we are interested in finding where workers in our area live.</li>
						<li>Set the <b>Analysis Type</b> to Distance/Direction, because we are interested in finding the direction of where our workers work.</li>
						<li>Set the <b>Year</b> to 2011, because we are only interested in the most recent year.</li>
						<li>Set the <b>Job Type</b> to Primary Jobs, because that is the scope of job types that most interests us.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Click Go and you should now see the results of your new settings.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_7.png" width="585" height="361"/>
						<p class="caption">Analysis Results</p>
					<p>Now we will want to refine our results by Industry Segment. At the top left of the menu you will see a Display Settings box. </p> 
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_8.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Display Settings</p>
					<p>Select All Workers > Industry Segment > Industry: Goods Producing</p> 
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_9.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Refining Display Settings</p>
					<p>The map should now automatically update to reflect your new analysis:</p> 
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_10.png" width="645" height="345"/>
						<p class="caption">Updated Map Based off of New Display Settings</p>
					<p>Now that we have our results, we will download a KML to be able to view this data in Google Earth. In the Report/Map Outputs box on the left side of the page, select <u>Export Geography</u>.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_11.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Export Geography</p>
					<p>Now select the type of file we want to download. In this case, we want the KML. </p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_12.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Choose the Correct Export Format</p>
					<p>Then choose the correct download type. In this case, want <font style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline">Download Geography Export</font>.</p>
						<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepOne/StepOne_13.png"/>
						<p class="caption">Choose the Download Type</p>
					<p>In a moment, your download will start. You can either view this file now in Google Earth, or wait until we have finished the analysis. Either way Step One is finished!</p>

					<p>Now that you have identified our local manufacturing capacity, let's identify local industry partners. The Regional Data Portal at the EAPDD has all the data we need. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://01ee6d1dd95ae76b2dccdb1a21f0373f424169a7.googledrive.com/host/0ByvsZKaRY1-9cmk5OG5CbkhMZHc/index.html">here</a> to visit the site.

					<p class="caption">EAPDD Regional Data Portal - Map</p>
					<p>The left side of the map has a menu for viewing various map layers. First, uncheck the EAPDD Boundary checkbox and then click on the Business Development tab. Next, after a new list of layers unfolds, check the box next to Small Business - Manufacturing.</p>
					<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepTwo/StepTwo_2.png"/>

					<p>Now that all of the data has been colelcted, we will proceed to visualize it using using Google Earth.</p>
					<p>First, navigate to the folder where you stored the three KMLs. Double-click each file until you see them listed in the Google Earth Places Menu:</p>
					<img src="tutorial_imgs/StepFour/StepFour_2.png"/>
					<p class="caption">Google Earth Places Menu</p>
					<p>Now, because our extent is nationwide, we will want to zoom in to our site. Within the places menu, double-click on "Selection Areas" to zoom in to our site. </p>
